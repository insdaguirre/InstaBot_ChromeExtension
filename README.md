## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Smart Account Detection

The extension now **intelligently distinguishes between public and private accounts**:

1. **Follow Button Analysis:** Monitors button state changes after clicking "Follow"
2. **Public Account Detection:** If button changes to "Following" ‚Üí Account is public and successfully followed ‚úÖ
3. **Private Account Detection:** If button changes to "Requested" ‚Üí Account is private, automatically unfollowed üîÑ
4. **Automatic Cleanup:** Private account follow requests are immediately removed to maintain clean account status
5. **Accurate Counting:** Only public accounts count toward your follow goal

### Batch-Based System

The extension uses a **batch-based approach** for better organization and control:

1. **Follow Sessions:** Each follow session creates a new batch with timestamp
2. **Public Account Storage:** Only successfully followed public accounts are stored in batches
3. **Selective Unfollow:** Choose specific batches to unfollow instead of all users
4. **Search-Based Unfollow:** Uses Instagram's search to find specific users efficiently

### Chrome Extension Workflow

1. **Install the Extension:** Load the extension into Chrome
2. **Navigate to Instagram:** Log into Instagram normally in your browser
3. **Go to Target Page:**
   - **For Following:** Navigate to any user's followers page
   - **For Unfollowing:** Navigate to your own following page
4. **Open Extension:** Click the extension icon in Chrome
5. **Follow/Unfollow:** Enter count to follow or select batch to unfollow
6. **Automated Actions:** The extension performs the actions with smart delays and private account detection

## üîç Private Account Detection Feature

### What It Does
The extension now **intelligently detects the difference between public and private Instagram accounts** during follow operations, ensuring you only follow public accounts while automatically handling private accounts.

### How It Works
1. **Button State Monitoring:** After clicking "Follow", the extension monitors button text changes
2. **Public Account Detection:** 
   - Button changes from "Follow" ‚Üí "Following"
   - Account is successfully followed and added to batch
   - Counts toward your follow goal ‚úÖ
3. **Private Account Detection:**
   - Button changes from "Follow" ‚Üí "Requested" 
   - Account is automatically unfollowed immediately
   - Not added to batch, doesn't count toward goal üîÑ

### Benefits
- **No Pending Requests:** Private account follow requests are automatically removed
- **Clean Account Status:** Your Instagram account stays clean with no pending requests
- **Accurate Follow Counts:** Only public accounts count toward your follow target
- **Better Instagram Health:** Avoids accumulating pending requests that can hurt account reputation
- **Automatic Cleanup:** No manual intervention needed for private accounts

### Example Workflow
```
User clicks "Follow" on @user123
‚Üì
Extension waits 1.5 seconds for button update
‚Üì
Button shows "Following" ‚Üí Public account ‚úÖ
OR
Button shows "Requested" ‚Üí Private account, auto-unfollowed üîÑ
```
