# üì∏ Insta Bot - Vintage GUI Edition

![Insta Bot GUI](gui.png)

A local, privacy-first Instagram automation tool with a retro Windows-style interface. This bot allows you to safely grow and manage your Instagram account by following and unfollowing users in batches, with full anti-detection logic and batch tracking.

---

## üöÄ Why Local? (Design Choices)

- **Privacy & Security:** Your Instagram credentials and data never leave your device. No cloud, no server, no risk of leaks.
- **Control:** You decide when and how the bot runs. No background daemons or 24/7 server processes.
- **Simplicity:** No server setup, no port forwarding, no cloud costs. Just run the app on your own computer.
- **Stealth:** Local operation means you can use your own IP, proxies, and browser for maximum anti-detection.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Current Configuration

1. **Launch the GUI:** Run `batch_follow_gui.py` to open the vintage-style interface
2. **Configure Settings:**
   - Enter your Instagram username and password
   - Set target accounts (comma-separated)
   - Specify "Follows per Account" (exact number to follow from each target)
   - Choose whether to show the browser during automation
3. **Start a Batch:**
   - Click "START NEW BATCH" to begin following
   - The bot logs into Instagram using Selenium
   - For each target account, it opens the followers modal
   - Follows exactly the number of users you specified
   - Waits 1 second between each follow action
   - Saves all followed usernames to the batch log
4. **Batch Management:**
   - All batches appear in the "FOLLOW BATCHES" section
   - Each batch shows timestamp, source accounts, and user count
   - Click "Unfollow All" on any batch to unfollow those users
   - Delete unfollowed batches to clean up the interface

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Follow Logic
- **Exact Count:** Follows exactly the number specified in "Follows per Account"
- **No Verification:** Assumes all button clicks are successful (no button text checking)
- **1-Second Delays:** Waits 1 second between each follow action
- **Smart Scrolling:** Automatically scrolls the followers modal to find more users
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Won't follow users already followed in previous sessions

### Batch Management
- **Persistent Storage:** All batches saved to `instagram_data/follow_batches.json`
- **Real-time Updates:** GUI refreshes automatically to show new batches
- **User Tracking:** Each batch contains usernames, follow timestamps, and source accounts
- **Unfollow Support:** One-click unfollow for entire batches

### Anti-Detection Features
- **Randomized Delays:** Built-in delays between actions
- **Browser Options:** Can run headless or visible browser
- **Session Management:** Fresh browser sessions for each batch
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of Instagram rate limits and blocks

---

## üì¶ Data Storage

- All user, batch, and log data is stored in the `instagram_data/` directory
- No data is ever sent to a remote server
- You can back up or delete your data at any time

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Rate Limits:** Instagram may temporarily block actions if you follow too many users too quickly
- **Account Safety:** Use reasonable follow counts and take breaks between batches
- **Educational Use:** This tool is for educational and personal use only
- **Terms of Service:** Excessive automation may violate Instagram's terms of service

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

- **"Try Again Later" Error:** Instagram has temporarily blocked actions. Wait and try again later.
- **Bot Follows Only One User:** Check that your target accounts have public followers and the bot can access them.
- **Batch Not Appearing:** Check the status log for errors and ensure the batch completed successfully.
